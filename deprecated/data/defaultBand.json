  "bio": " \nThe supreme genius of the counterculture of the 1960s was the Los Angeles composer,\narranger, freak and jester Frank Zappa\n(169).\nZappa was more than a brilliant and prolific composer.\nHe was a new kind of composer, one who knew no stylistic barrier: he\nbridged rock and pop and rhythm'n'blues and jazz and classical music.\nAnd one who knew no rules of harmony: he would play anything that\nmade sense to him, not to a certain tradition.\nZappa co-invented the concept album (he even released a double album\nwhen most\nrock musicians were barely beginning to make LPs), the rock opera,\nprogressive-rock.\nHe was the first rock musician to consciously use the\nstudio as an instrument.\nHe did not just use the band or the orchestra as ensembles of\ninstruments.\nIn a post-modern vein, Zappa\ncomposed music using snippets of music inspired to pre-existing music:\nhis unit of composition was not a \"sound\" but was an organized sound,\nthat the listener could relate to an established genre.\nAnd he made no distinction between tv commercials, doo-wop, music-hall,\nclassical ballets, jazz improvisation or dissonant music.\nA living musical encyclopedia, Zappa managed to excel in all of these\ngenres.\nHe could have been a giant in any of them.\n\nZappa implicitly realized that music is a non-representational art, and that's why folksingers added lyrics to the music. However, a stylistic quotation is a form of representational art because it relates directly to an aspect of society that the listener is familiar with. Zappa saw that, in order to make a statement about society, a musician can use the sounds that are stereotypical within that society, from commercial jingles to nursery rhymes to the silly voices of cartoons to any mainstream genre of music.\n\nFor better and for worse, his musical persona includes an odd aspect: a\npassion for satirical lyrics.\nHe always seemed more comfortable wearing the clothes of the clown than\nrewriting the history of music.\nHe always seemed to think of satire as his first and main art,\nand music as a sort of soundtrack to it.\nHis satirical tone ranged from the childish joke to bitter sarcasm, and\nhe\ntended to excel at the latter end of the spectrum.\nHis favorite victim was hypocrisy, regardless of how it appears in\nsociety.\nHis natural targets were televangelists, corporations, politicians, but\nalso ordinary people, whether \"dancing fools\", \"catholic girls\" or\n\"jewish princesses\".\nHe showed no mercy for the human species, and relentlessly exposed its\nvices and perversion.\nHe made fun of virtually every race, people, profession, hobby, habit,\njob, ideology, religion, etc. on this planet.\nMost of his repertory is \"political\", but without actually being\nmilitant.\nZappa was not a protester or an activist.\nHe was merely a man who used his brain. It turned out that, in one of\nnature's most bizarre accidents, Zappa the satirical genius shared the\nsame brain with Zappa the musical genius.\nZappa debuted with three masterpieces that were eclectic cut-ups of\npopular styles turned upside down: the concept album Freak Out (march 1966),\nthe rock operetta Absolutely Free (november 1966) and the experimental collage\nof We're Only In It For The Money (august and september 1967). Zappa turned orchestral with\nLumpy Gravy (october 1967) and then fine-tuned that idea with\nthe six King Kong variations on Uncle Meat (february 1968) and with\nthe 19-minute Music For Electric Violin And Low Budget Orchestra,\noff Jean-Luc Ponty's King Kong (october 1969).\nZappa proved to be equally at easy playing melodic themes with a\njazz band, on Hot Rats (august 1969) and especially on\nBurnt Weeny Sandwich (1969),\nthat included the 22-minute Little House I Used to Live In,\nand deconstructing spastic free-jazz on\nthe dadaistic masterpiece Weasels Ripped My Flesh (1969).\nHis self-indulgence knew no limit, but at least\nWaka/Jawaka (may 1972), Grand Wazoo (may 1972) and\nOrchestral Favourites (september 1975) found a magical balance between his\npop, jazz and classical propensities. His lighter vein, perhaps best\nsummarized on Roxy And Elsewhere (1974), always coexisted with\nhis classical ambitions, as demonstrated on the\nKent Nagano-conducted Zappa (january 1983) and on the\nPierre Boulez-conducted Perfect Stranger (1984), and with his\nfluent jazz idiom, as immortalized on Jazz From Hell (1986).\n\n If English is your first language and you could translate the Italian text, please contact me.\n\nScroll down for recent reviews in english.\n\n",
